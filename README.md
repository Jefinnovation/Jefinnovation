- 👋  Hi, I’m @Jefinnovation
- 👀 I’m interested in ...building AI-powered automation tools, voice agents, and CRM systems that actually make people’s lives easier—especially in real estate, trades, and small business.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...full-stack development through raw experimentation, Replit builds, Make.com automations, and Relevance AI agent design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...agentic AI tools, CRM workflows, automation logic, or anything that can help push my TrackHammer and PropTrack projects to production.
- 📫 How to reach me ... GitHub
- 😄 Pronouns: ...he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I’m not a coder by trade—but I’ve been up at 6 a.m. every day teaching myself how to build software that actually works, and I’m not stopping.
